1. Problem Statement/Opportunity*: 
If you’ve ever tried to discover the right candidate in a pool full of unqualified talent, you’ll know that your options are limited. You’ll choose the best person you can find at the time—not the best fit for the job. But it’s not always about the number of candidates who apply; the best way to hire the right people is often from a smaller pipeline of more qualified talent. 
1.1. Hiring teams want to hire as fast as possible, because vacant positions cost money and delay operations.
1.2. Many companies struggle to attract and hire diverse candidates and unconscious biases are often the reason.
1.3. Recruiters facing lots of problems, because candidates not provide all information into a single file.


2. Project Description*:
Portfolio (we can also say candidate resume) that contain all details about the candidates. I divided all the skills, project, experience ,.... etc to different-different section. It is very helpful for the recruiters then can see all the details about the candidates. In a single profile, using this strategy we can save the recruiters time and stress.
